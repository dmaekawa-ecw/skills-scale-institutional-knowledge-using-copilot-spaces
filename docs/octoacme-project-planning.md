# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team (facilitated by Project Manager or Scrum Master)
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria (led by Product Manager with UX Designer input)
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
5. Identify dependencies and risks (tracked in [Decision Log](octoacme-decision-log-template.md))
6. Create release plan and milestone map (coordinated with Release Manager)
