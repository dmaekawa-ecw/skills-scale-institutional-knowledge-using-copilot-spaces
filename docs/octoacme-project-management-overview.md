# OctoAcme Project Management Overview

## Purpose
Provide a concise, shareable introduction to how OctoAcme runs projects so new teammates can quickly understand our approach, roles, and key artifacts.

## Scope
Applies to all cross-functional projects that deliver product features, services, or integrations.

## Principles
- Customer-first: prioritize customer value and usability.
- Iterative delivery: deliver small, testable increments.
- Clear ownership: each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead.
- Data-informed decisions: measure impact and iterate based on evidence.
- Psychological safety: encourage feedback and learning.

## Core Roles
See [Roles and Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md) for detailed role descriptions.

**Essential Roles:**
- **Project Manager (PM):** coordinates delivery, schedules, risk, communications
- **Product Manager (PdM):** defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success
- **Developers:** implement features, collaborate on design and testability

**Supporting Roles (as needed):**
- **Scrum Master:** facilitates agile ceremonies, coaches team, removes blockers
- **UX Designer:** ensures user-centric design and usability
- **Data Analyst:** analyzes data to inform decision-making and track success metrics
- **Technical Writer:** prepares clear documentation for processes and users
- **Release Manager:** manages deployment schedules and incident response
- **QA/Testing:** validates quality and acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders:** provide inputs and approvals

## Key Artifacts
- Project Charter / One-pager

- [Communication Plan](octoacme-communication-plan-template.md)
- [Role Handoff Documents](octoacme-role-handoff-template.md) (when team members transition)

## Lifecycle (high-level)
1. Initiation: problem statement, stakeholders, high-level timeline.
2. Planning: scope, resources, milestones, dependencies.
3. Execution: build, test, review, iterate.
4. Release: deploy, verify, announce.
5. Close & Retrospective: capture learnings and next steps.

## Communication Cadence
- Daily standups facilitated by Scrum Master (if using agile)
- Weekly sync between PM + PdM
- Bi-weekly design reviews (if UX Designer involved)
- Weekly metrics review (if Data Analyst involved)
- Monthly stakeholder updates
- Ad-hoc escalations as needed
- See [Communication Plan Template](octoacme-communication-plan-template.md) for detailed guidance

## How to use these docs
- Keep the Project Charter updated in the project repo.
- Add process-specific docs into `.copilot/` if you want Copilot Spaces to use them as context.
