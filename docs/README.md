# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

## Overview

OctoAcme follows a structured, iterative project management approach designed to deliver customer value efficiently while maintaining quality and team collaboration. Our process emphasizes clear ownership, data-informed decisions, and psychological safety, ensuring teams can deliver features and services with confidence. Each project follows a well-defined lifecycle from initiation through retrospective, with distinct phases that guide teams from initial problem validation to continuous improvement.

The project lifecycle begins with **Initiation**, where teams validate business needs, identify stakeholders, and create a lightweight project one-pager with measurable success metrics. This leads into **Planning**, where approved initiatives are broken down into shippable increments with clear acceptance criteria, timelines, and dependencies mapped in a risk register. During **Execution**, teams follow daily standups and weekly syncs while maintaining quality through unit tests, integration tests, and automated CI/CD pipelines. Work progresses through a structured board workflow (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done) with small pull requests and peer reviews ensuring code quality.

**Release and Deployment** follows a standardized approach with pre-release checklists, smoke testing in staging environments, and documented rollback plans to minimize production risks. All releases include comprehensive notes and stakeholder communications coordinated through support and product teams. Following each release or milestone, teams conduct **Retrospectives** to capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements, creating a culture of continuous enhancement.

Key roles driving this process include Project Managers (coordinating delivery, schedules, and risk), Product Managers (defining outcomes and prioritizing backlogs), Developers (implementing features with quality), and QA/Testing teams (validating acceptance criteria). Communication follows a structured cadence with twice-weekly standups, weekly PM-PdM syncs, and monthly stakeholder updates, while escalation paths are clearly defined from team-level triage through sponsor-level decisions for business-critical issues.
